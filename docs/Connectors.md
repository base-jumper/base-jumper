### Low-Cost Tooling
For prototyping, or even low-volume production, it is possible to get by with some basic low-cost tooling.

##### Crimping
A set of general purpose Engineer PA-21 crimp pliers will work for both wire sizes 18-22AWG. These are available from a range of sources, including Adafruit, DigiKey and Amazon.

##### Extraction
The Molex extraction tool is not expensive. But if you don't have one and you need something quickly, you can try using a 1mm drill bit. Insert the blunt end (not the cutting end!) into the connector to release the contact. To make it work nicely you may need to grind a small shamfer onto the end of the drill bit.
