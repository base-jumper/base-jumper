**Hey!**  We're glad you're here.

If this is your first visit, you might like to start at the [intro] and [concepts] pages.

Searching for the right base board for your application? Check out our [boards]({{"docs/boards/Boards.html" | relative_url}}) section.

Got your hardware and ready to start coding? Here's the [programming]({{"docs/Programming.html" | relative_url}}) introduction.

If you're already beyond blinky, and are ready to start writing real code you can find our API documentation on the [circuits]({{"docs/circuits" | relative_url}}) pages.

For board configuration and administration, see the [terminal]({{"docs/terminal/Terminal.html" | relative_url}}).

All of the above and more can also be accessed through the site contents and search features. Happy reading!
